# General Classes

These are classes used across the entire project

## DataPreparation

The most important class. It makes sure all models use the same same data, dissects said data, and provides some incredibly useful methods.

### __limit_vars

The purpose of this method is to limit the colinearity of the features in the data. The in-code documentation on this method is extensive on the reasoning behind the different recombinations/omissions.

## Performance

This class makes sure that the performance is calculated in a uniform capacity.

## Deprecated Classes

Both PCA and Tree are classes that have been deprecated. They are still included in the source code for legacy.
